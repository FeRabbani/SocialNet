Here, We use network theoretical approaches to analyze the data we obtained from web forums in public and darkweb by studying the
connectivity features of the members and the threads within a wide selection of forums
(including dark and semi-dark) and establish several characteristic behavioral patterns.
Our findings reveal both common and rather different features in the two types of
behavior.
